# VeloHARMO
## VeloHARMO is the pipeline for translation velocity harmonization from native organism to host organism. VeloHARMO consists of two crucial components: 1.Deep learning modelling for velocity prediction in both native and host organisms. 2.Genetic algorithm to generate the harmonized mRNA sequences from native organism to host organism.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Heterologous expression is a conventional strategy for expressing foreign genes encoding interested proteins in host organisms. However, achieving high protein production is challenging. Therefore, designing mRNA sequences to improve production efficiency while maintaining protein activity is crucial. In recent years, several algorithms, such as codon optimization and harmonization have been developed, but not always successful as codon usage frequency does not accurately reflect translation velocity. In this study, we proposed a novel concept called “translation velocity harmonization” and developed a pipeline: VeloHARMO for translation velocity harmonization, which involves fine-tuning protein co-translational folding into mRNA design and optimization for the first time.</p>
