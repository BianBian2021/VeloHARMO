# VeloHARMO
## VeloHARMO is the pipeline for translation velocity harmonization from native organism to host organism
## VeloHARMO consists of two crucial components: 1.Deep learning modelling for velocity prediction in both native and host organisms. 2.A genetic algorithm to generate the harmonized mRNA sequences from native organism to host organism.
